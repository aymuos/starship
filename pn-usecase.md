# PN-Usecase
Multi-Checkpoint Delivery Delay Prediction
## Abstract 

Develop a predictive model that predicts parcel level delays and container level delays. At every checkpoint where parcel is scanned. Based on historical events we need to predict the duration of delivery for the next level.

Idea : 
The core problem involves developing a multi-level predictive system that forecasts delivery delays at both parcel and container levels across various checkpoints in the logistics pipeline. The system needs to predict delivery durations at each scanning checkpoint, from customer drop-off through node hubs, sorting terminals, distribution terminals, and final delivery to consumers

The two granularities:
Parcel-level predictions: Estimating delivery duration for individual packages at each scanning checkpoint
Container-level predictions: Predicting delays for containers (which hold multiple parcels)

The system needs to predict the "duration to next checkpoint" dynamically as items move through the logistics network, updating predictions at each scan point based on:

- Historical transit patterns
- Current network conditions
- Package/container characteristics
- Route information

## NOVEL RESEARCH AREAS 
1. Multi-Checkpoint Predictive Framework
Most existing research focuses on end-to-end delay prediction rather than checkpoint-specific modeling. The proposed approach of predicting delays at every scanning point represents a novel contribution, as current literature primarily addresses:
a) Single-stage predictions

b) Binary classification (delayed/on-time)

c) End-of-journey forecasting

2. Hierarchical Delay Propagation Modeling
Limited research addresses how delays propagate and compound through multi-stage logistics networks. The architecture-based approach could contribute novel insights into:

a) Cascade effect modeling across checkpoints

b) Network-level delay interdependencies

c) Stage-specific delay characteristics

3. Real-Time Adaptive Prediction
Current models often lack dynamic adaptation capabilities as parcels move through the network. Opportunities exist for:

a) Context-aware prediction updates at each checkpoint

b) Real-time model recalibration based on intermediate scanning events

c) Adaptive threshold adjustment for different logistics segments

## Technical Innovation Opportunities


Multi-Level Prediction Architecture: Developing a hierarchical prediction system that models delays at different granularities (parcel-level, batch-level, container-level) represents significant novelty.

Temporal-Spatial Modeling: Integrating time-series analysis with network topology to capture both temporal patterns and spatial dependencies in the logistics network.

Feature Engineering Innovation: Leveraging checkpoint-specific features such as:

a) Scanning event timestamps and intervals

b) Local processing capacity and congestion

c) Regional transportation conditions

d) Historical checkpoint performance patterns

## where rl can work 

Meta-Controller for Prediction Accuracy

Treat the deep-learning predictor as part of the environment. At each checkpoint, an RL agent selects which features to include, which model variant (LSTM vs. Transformer vs. GNN) to invoke, or how much historical context to use.

Reward is directly tied to the final prediction error: e.g. negative absolute difference between the model’s end-to-end estimate and the true delivery time once the package arrives.

Over many episodes, the agent learns a policy that dynamically configures your hierarchical predictor to minimize its overall E2E error.

In practice you would:

Train your hierarchical DL + GNN predictor to output a baseline end-to-end ETA.

Simulate delivery episodes (or use logged data) where at each timestep the RL agent makes decisions (routing/resource/model selection) and receives a reward based on final E2E error.

Use a suitable RL algorithm (e.g. PPO, A3C, or multi-agent DDPG) and validate improvement in end-to-end prediction accuracy against a static-policy baseline.

This RL layer sits above your per-checkpoint predictors, learning to orchestrate both logistics decisions and predictor configurations to minimize the gap between predicted and actual total delivery time.
