### Dataset analysis

- Experiments use a real package pick-up dataset from Hangzhou (2021-07-10 to 2021-10-10) with 8,600 AOIs, 550 couriers, and routes up to 77 locations and 45 AOIs (averages 8.76 locations and 4.34 AOIs),
filtered to ≤20 locations and ≤10 AOIs per sample for training.
The split is 65/17/10 days for train/validation/test, 
with average actual arrival times near one hour and empirical evidence that AOI transfers are far fewer than location-level transfers (≈6.20 vs 50.97), supporting the AOI-first transfer prior.

- Graph transformer architectures could also replace or augment GAT-e modules to better capture long-range dependencies in courier routes
-  integrating causal reasoning into route and time prediction could be highly impactful. This could help identify which factors actually cause delays versus mere correlations, 
    leading to more robust predictions and better intervention strategies. Causal graphs could model relationships between weather, traffic, courier behavior, and delivery performance
