### [DeepAR: Probabilistic Forecasting with Autoregressive Recurrent Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04110)

**Domain**: Retail  
**ML Area**: Probabilistic Forecasting / Deep Learning / Time Series  

**Authors**: David Salinas, Valentin Flunkert, Jan Gasthaus, Tim Januschowski  
**Published**: Amazon Research, 2017  

**Abstract (Summary)**:
