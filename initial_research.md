### [DeepAR: Probabilistic Forecasting with Autoregressive Recurrent Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04110)

**Domain**: Retail  
**ML Area**: Probabilistic Forecasting / Deep Learning / Time Series  

**Authors**: David Salinas, Valentin Flunkert, Jan Gasthaus, Tim Januschowski  
**Published**: Amazon Research, 2017  

**Abstract (Summary)**:  
DeepAR is a deep learning method for forecasting multivariate time series using autoregressive RNNs. Unlike classical models, it produces probabilistic forecasts and handles thousands of related time series — like those in retail demand.

**Why it’s interesting**:  
- Retail datasets often include large numbers of similar time series (e.g., product-level sales)  
- Handles cold-start scenarios using item metadata  
- Can be extended for hierarchical forecasting or multimodal inputs

### [A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for the Vehicle Routing Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04240)

**Domain**: Supply Chain / Logistics  
**ML Area**: Reinforcement Learning / Combinatorial Optimization  

**Authors**: Mohammadreza Nazari, Afshin Oroojlooy, Lawrence Snyder, Martin Takáč  
**Published**: NeurIPS Workshop, 2018  

**Abstract (Summary)**:  
This work introduces an attention-based deep reinforcement learning model to solve the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP). It avoids hand-crafted heuristics and learns policies through simulation.

**Why it’s interesting**:  
- Traditional logistics problems are NP-hard and rely on heuristics  
- Learns routing decisions from data, adaptable to real-time needs  
- Can inspire work on multi-agent routing, delivery drones, or joint inventory-routing problems
